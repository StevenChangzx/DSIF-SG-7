# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis

### Overview

Our first module in DSI covers:
- Basic statistics and probability
- Many Python programming concepts
- Programmatically interacting with files and directories
- Visualizations
- EDA
- Working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting

You might wonder if you're ready to start doing data science. While you still have **tons** to learn, there are many aspects of the data science process that you're ready to tackle. Project 1 aims to allow you to practice and demonstrate these skills.

For our first project, we're going to take a look at aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates in the United States. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to address our problem statement.

The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):
* [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat)
* [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en.html)

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry.

### Problem Statement


> * You work for a school district that has asked you to advise their high school students on what SAT or ACT score they should be aiming for based on their intended area of study or school preferences.

### Datasets

#### Provided Data

There are 3 datasets included in the [`data`](./data/) folder for this project. 


* [`sat_2019_by_intended_college_major.csv`](./data/sat_2019_by_intended_college_major.csv): 2019 SAT Scores by Intended College Major ([source](https://reports.collegeboard.org/pdf/2019-total-group-sat-suite-assessments-annual-report.pdf))
* [`sat_2019_ca.csv`](./data/sat_2019_ca.csv): 2019 SAT Scores in California by School
* [`sat_act_by_college.csv`](./data/sat_act_by_college.csv): Ranges of Accepted ACT & SAT Student Scores by Colleges ([source](https://www.compassprep.com/college-profiles/))

**Make sure you cross-reference your data with your data sources to eliminate any data collection or data entry issues.**

#### Additional Data
You are welcome to add any other data sources you find online to support your analysis, but this is **not required**.

### Deliverables

All of your projects will comprise of a written technical report and a presentation. As we continue in the course, your technical report will grow in complexity, but for this initial project it will comprise:
- A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.
- A README markdown file the provides an introduction to and overview of your project.
- Your presentation slideshow rendered as a .pdf file.
**NOTE**: Your entire Github repository will be evaluated as your technical report. Make sure that your files and directories are named appropriately, that all necessary files are included, and that no unnecessary or incomplete files are included.

For your first presentation, you'll be presenting to a **non-technical** audience. You should prepare a slideshow with appropriately scaled visuals to complement a compelling narrative. **Presentation duration will be 10 minutes.**

### Technical Report Starter Code

Future projects will require you to decide on the entire structure of your technical report. Here, we provide you with [starter code](./code/starter-code.ipynb) in a Jupyter notebook that will help to guide your data exploration and analysis. **If you choose to edit the core structure of this notebook, make sure you don't exclude any of the requested operations**.

### Suggested Resources

Here's a link on [how to give a good lightning talk](https://www.semrush.com/blog/16-ways-to-prepare-for-a-lightning-talk/), which provides some good recommendations for short presentations.

[Here's a great summary](https://towardsdatascience.com/storytelling-with-data-a-data-visualization-guide-for-business-professionals-97d50512b407) of the main points of the book _Storytelling with Data_, which I can't recommend enough. [Here's a blog post](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/8/9/my-guiding-principles) by the author about his guiding principles for visualizations.

### Submission

**Materials must be submitted before 1 Oct 2022 12 pm through your GitHub account repo shared with the Teaching Team.**

Your technical report will be hosted on Github Enterprise. Make sure it includes:

- A README.md (that isn't this file)
- Jupyter notebook(s) with your analysis (renamed to describe your project)
- Data files
- Presentation slides
- Any other necessary files (images, etc.)

---

### Presentation Structure

- **Presentation Time: 10 minutes**
- Use Google Slides or some other visual aid (Keynote, Powerpoint, etc).
- Consider the audience. Assume you are presenting to a non-technical audience (executives with the College Board, school administrators, admissions counselors, State officials, etc.).
- Start with the **data science problem**.
- Use visuals that are appropriately scaled and interpretable.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level, **CODE IS ALWAYS INAPPROPRIATE FOR A NON-TECHNICAL AUDIENCE**).
- Talk about your primary findings.
- Make sure you provide **clear recommendations** that follow logically from your analyses and narrative and answer your data science problem.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.
