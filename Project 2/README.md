# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

## Background and Problem Statement

Purchasing a house can be a huge commitment . As a real estate agent, I  would like our clients 
- to find out which features have greater impact to the house value
- to find out how much they probably need to spend on purchasing a house with features that they want

To solve the problem, I will create a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset [Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/t/2dde5663e03b4165b853ff65e723c26d). (The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.) My model will predict the price of a house at sale and based on coefficients of my best model, I will find the most influencing factores to the house sale prices for clients' reference.




## The Project Process
1. EDA
2. Train-test split
3. Data processing with robust pipeline (including OOP)
4. Refining models over time (including repeating previews steps)
6. Result based on the best Model

## Result
Top 5 most vital features affecting the house sale price (sorted by coefficients of the best model)

1.	Roof Matl_ClyTile	 
2.	BsmtFin SF 1	 
3.	Roof Matl_Membran	 
4.	Bsmt Unf SF	 
5.	Total Bsmt SF	 

## Conclusion (Recommendation)
I would suggest my clients to primarily consider the roof material, basement and total area in square feet beacuse these factors contribute substantially to house sale price.
