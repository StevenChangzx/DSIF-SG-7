# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

## Background and Problem Statement

Purchasing a house can be a huge commitment . As a real estate agent, we  would like our clients 
- to find out which features have greater impact to the house value
- to find out how much they probably need to spend on purchasing a house with features that they want

To solve the problem, I will create a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset [Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/t/2dde5663e03b4165b853ff65e723c26d). This model will predict the price of a house at sale.



The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.

## The Project Process
1. EDA
2. Train-test split
3. Data processing with robust pipeline (OOP)
4. Refining models over time (RandomizedSearchCV)
